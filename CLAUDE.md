# Project Memory

## Development Workflow
- **Always commit to the dev branch first** before merging to main
- This ensures the project doesn't face any bugs, challenges or errors in production
- The main branch is connected to Vercel for automatic deployments

## Editor Configuration
- Main editor: Cursor

## Project Structure
- Repository: https://github.com/wissamyah/projectSPA.git
- Branches:
  - `main`: Production branch (auto-deploys to Vercel)
  - `dev`: Development branch for testing changes
